A discontinued gamemode for GTA:SA Multiplayer written in Pawn language. The mode isn't in runnable form, SQL table files are missing, have to be reconstructed from the code. A few include files also missing, it's possible to fix them with a few hours of Googling.

I just want to share the gamemode, it was a nostalgic back then, maybe somebody will benefit from it.
